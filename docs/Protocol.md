## Gossip Protocol

  What is it?
  ```
    Gossip Protocols are inspired by the spreading of disease. Nodes are in communication, and aware of, a small number of nodes, which they then transfer information to, which are then relayed to other nodes. This is efficient and evenly spreads load across systems in the network, while remaining fault tolerant.
